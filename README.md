# Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey and projects completed during the Oasis Infobyte Internship! This experience has been a fantastic opportunity to enhance my Java development skills and delve into real-world projects. Here's a brief overview of the tasks I successfully completed:

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

### Description
The first project involved creating a dynamic Number Guessing Game. Users were given 5 attempts to guess a random system-generated number. After each round, they had the option to continue playing or exit, with a scorecard displaying their points. This project was a great introduction to user interaction and game logic.

### Key Learnings
- User interface design
- Random number generation
- Score tracking and game flow control

## Project 2: Online Examination System

### Description
The second project was the development of an Online Examination System. This comprehensive system included a secure login interface, the ability to update usernames and passwords, and a timed quiz with 30 seconds per question. The system automatically submitted answers when the timer ran out, displaying the final score.

### Key Learnings
- User authentication and account management
- Timer implementation for quizzes
- Handling and processing quiz submissions

## Project 3: Certificate of Completion

### Description
Upon successful completion of the internship, I received a certificate acknowledging my dedication and accomplishments during the Oasis Infobyte Internship. This serves as a testament to the skills I've acquired and the challenges I've overcome.

### Key Learnings
- Reflecting on personal and professional growth
- Acknowledging the importance of dedication and perseverance
